VR-Based Machine Training Application

Project Overview

This project involves developing a VR-based training application using Unity 3D. The goal is to train users on the safety and proper usage of a specific machine. The application includes a realistic 3D model of the machine with interactive features, instructional videos, practical VR tasks, quizzes, and a certification process.

Features

1. Realistic 3D Model

Unity 3D Modeling: Develop a detailed 3D model of the machine.

Interactive Elements: Include interactive buttons, levers, and components for a realistic training experience.

2. Interactive Training Steps

Step 1: Instructional Video

Content Creation: Create a video explaining the machine's working principle, safety protocols, and do’s and don’ts.

Didactic Design: Ensure the video is educational and engaging, with clear explanations and visual aids.

Safety Tips: Highlight common accidents and provide preventive measures.

Step 2: Practical VR Task

Task Example: Users perform hands-on tasks, such as drilling a 20 mm hole into a part.

Real-time Interaction: Users receive immediate feedback on their performance.

Step 3: Knowledge Assessment (Quiz)

Quiz Integration: Include a set of questions to assess the user’s understanding.

Interactive Feedback: Provide guidance and explanations for incorrect answers.

Step 4: Certification

Automated Certification: Generate a certificate for users who correctly answer all questions.

Seamless Integration: Ensure the certificate is incorporated within the application.

3. VR Compatibility

VR-Goggle Support: Ensure the application is compatible with VR goggles for immersive training.

Demonstration: Present the application at the end of the semester.

Development Environment

Unity 3D: Primary development platform.

3D Modeling Tools: Blender or other 3D modeling software.

Video Creation Tools: Software for video production and editing.

VR Hardware: Compatible VR goggles for testing and demonstration.
