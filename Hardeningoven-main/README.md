<h1>VR-based Machine Training Application</h1>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>

This project involves developing a VR-based training application using Unity 3D. The goal is to train users on the safety and proper usage of a specific machine. The application includes a realistic 3D model of the machine with interactive features, instructional videos, practical VR tasks, quizzes, and a certification process.

<h3>Features</h3>

<h5>1. Realistic 3D Model</h5>
   
  • Unity 3D Modeling: Develop a detailed 3D model of the machine.
 
  • Interactive Elements: Include interactive buttons, levers, and other components for a realistic training experience.
 
<h5>2. Interactive Training Steps</h5>
   
Step 1: Instructional Video

 • Content Creation: Create a video explaining the machine's working principle, safety protocols, and do's and don'ts.
 
 • Didactic Design: Ensure the video is educational and engaging, with clear explanations and visual aids.
 
 • Safety Tips: Highlight common accidents and provide tips to avoid them.
 
Step 2: Practical VR Task

 • Task Example: Users perform tasks such as drilling a 20 mm hole into a part.
 
 • Real-time Feedback: Implement alerts and hints to guide users and correct mistakes.
 
 • Completion Notification: Provide feedback upon task completion, possibly through a popup.
 
Step 3: Knowledge Assessment

 • Quiz Integration: Include a set of questions to assess the user's understanding.
 
 • Interactive Feedback: Offer guidance and explanations for incorrect answers.
 
Step 4: Certification

 • Automated Certification: Generate a certificate for users who correctly answer all questions.
 
 • Integration: Ensure the certificate is seamlessly incorporated into the application.

<h5>3. VR Compatibility</h5>
   
 • VR-Goggle Support: Ensure the application is compatible with VR goggles for immersive training.
 
 • Demonstration: Present the application at the end of the semester.
 
<h4>Development Environment</h4>

 • Unity 3D: Primary development platform.
 
 • 3D Modeling Tools: Blender or other 3D modeling software.
 
 • Video Creation Tools: Software for video production and editing.
 
 • VR Hardware: Compatible VR goggles for testing and demonstration.
